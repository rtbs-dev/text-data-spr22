    "This homework deals with the goals you must define, along with the approaches you deem necessary to achieve those goals. \n",
    "Key to this will be a focus on your _workflows_: \n",

    "- are they reproducible? \n",
    "- are they maintainable? \n",
    "- are they well-justified and communicated? \n",

    "This is not a \"machine-learning\" course, but machine learning plays a large part in modern text analysis and NLP. \n",
    "Machine learning, in-turn, has a number of issues tracking and solving issues in a collaborative, asynchronous, distributed manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not inherently _wrong_ to use pre-configured models and libraries! \n",
    "In fact, you will likely be unable to create a set of ML algorithms that \"beat\" something others have spent 100's of hours creating, optimizing, and validating. \n",
    "However, to answer the three questions above, we need a way to explicitly track our decisions to use others' work, and efficiently _swap out_ that work for new ideas and directions as the need arises. \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is a \"part 1\" of sorts, where you will construct several inter-related pipelines in a way that will allow _much easier_ adjustment, experimentation, and measurement in \"part 2\""
